; TODO list in format suitable for Emacs Outline mode...

* Near future

** Deal with menu separators etc...

** Pie Menu Title...

** styles

* Teach GtkItemFactory GtkPieMenu manners

* new signal "wrong-direction"
  
  emit new signal (? "wrong-direction") which is emited when
  user choose bad direction in invisible PieMenu

  current solution: gdk_beeeeep

* support Pie menus in as many programs as possible (gimp, gnome, trapas3d,..)
  (and do not forget emacs, bash and wc) (/usr/bin/wc ...)

* www page...

* Persuade Gtk Team to incorporate following changes to Gtk

** gtk_widget_set_uposition

   rewrote gtk_widget_set_uposition code to handle also negative values -
   gtk_window_set_win_position is really ugly hack

** Better handling of window shapes

   Other X11 calls should be supported (XShapeCombineRectangles,
   XShapeCombineRegion,.. ) ... so some hidden desires (transparent pixmap in
   GtkPieMenu -> title) could be easily satisfied.
